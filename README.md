# Work Scheduler
At the moment, specifically made for scheduling lifeguards at the pool I work at. We currently use Google Sheets and it takes forever to schedule guards. Plus, we have to ask for days off using a paper - pretty inconvenient.

# About
Easily add shifts to a spreadsheet-style view by clicking onn the cell to edit the shift(s).

# Features
- Calculates total weekly hours for each worker automatically
- Calculates how may guards/front workers are working that day (morning/evening)
- Shift time presets based on seleceted role
- Can select a multiple of workers to complete an action for them all at once
- Undo/Redo buttons for changes made to shifts
- Workers log in with their email, the company code, and a password and are automatically synced to the worker profile with that email 
- Supports multiple companies
